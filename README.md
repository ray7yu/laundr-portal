## About
Collaborating with [Laundr](https://www.laundr.io/), this project's aim was to build an administrative portal that allows Laundr employees
to seamlessly view relevant data about their operations through a web browser. Various types of information can be viewed within the portal, including
users, orders, and general Laundr subscriptions. Each of these are similarly displayed with several desired paramaters, such as weight information for a 
current order or whether a subscription is still active at the moment. The data is stored on MongoDB atlas, and basic user authentication is 
implemented to protect confidential information. React.js is the primary framework utilized to develop the front-end interfaces of the application.

## Tools
React, HTML/CSS, Node.js, Express, and Mongoose were used to develop this app. </br>
MongoDB Atlas hosts the database holding information. </br>
Postman was used to test the Express API. </br>
Material UI was used for faster development of front-end components, and Chart.js was used to make flexible and visually appealing graphs.
