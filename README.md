## About
Collaborating with [Laundr](https://www.laundr.io/), this project's aim was to build an administrative portal that allows Laundr employees
to seamlessly view relevant data about their operations through a web browser. The data is stored on MongoDB atlas, and basic user authentication is 
implemented to protect confidential information.

## Tools
React, HTML/CSS, Node.js, Express, and Mongoose were used to develop this app. </br>
MongoDB Atlas hosts the database holding information. </br>
Material UI was used for faster development of front-end components, and Chart.js was used to make flexible and visually appealing graphs.

## Developers
Raymond Yu, Joseph Morales, Shen-Jou Tsai, Jayden Jones, Vincent Concepcion
